    <p class="yap" style="padding-left: 225px; padding-right: 75px; text-align: left;"><a href="/"
            style="color: blue;"><u>confessions.com</u></a> started as a funny silly little class project between its
        founders, Cameron Guglielmino and Zachariah Conyngham. However, the two decided that this little project
        deserved more than being presented to the class once. As such, <a href="/"
            style="color: blue;"><u>confessions.com</u></a> became somewhat of a passion project for the two, eventually
        continued by Cameron alone. This led to the official release of <a href="/"
            style="color: blue;"><u>confessions.com</u></a> in October of 2025, from a questionable PowerPoint
        presentation to the class encouraging organised crime to a truly impressive website that Mr Clark should
        definitely give an A for.<br>
        At first, <a href="/" style="color: blue;"><u>confessions.com</u></a> seemed like nothing more than a
        chaotic project as the result of leaving two mentally deranged people to present whatever they wanted to the
        class. However, aside from all the organised crime promotion (RIP Crime Chats), <a href="/"
            style="color: blue;"><u>confessions.com</u></a> showed promise of an actually decent website. As such,
        Cameron continued the project as a legacy, vowing to turn <a href="/"
            style="color: blue;"><u>confessions.com</u></a> from chaos into greatness. During mid-2025, the project took
        over him, becoming his only goal as he "grinded" for hours on end to make <a href="/"
            style="color: blue;"><u>confessions.com</u></a> what it is today.
