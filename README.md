# Cameron Guglielmino - CPT AT 3 Documentation

## **Week 1 - Project Description** ##
I want to create a platform for users to be able to read crime stories. To accomplish this, users will sign up to the platform, and they will be able to read stories published by other users. Users will be able to like other crime stories, and the most popular/liked stories will appear on the front page.

Users will also be able to customise their profile with a username, profile picture and about me. They can also follow other users, and they will receive notifications when that user publishes a story. Users can also set their password.

# **Functional Requirements:**
- Users should be able to sign up to the site and log in with the same account at a later date.
- Users should be able to customise their profile (e.g profile picture, username, password)
- Users should be able to view and follow other users.

# **Non-Functional Requirements:**
- The app should be able to load webpages in under 2 seconds.
- The app should be easy to navigate for new users.
- The system should be able to support at least 1000 different users.
- The system should be able to store info of each different user (e.g username, password, id)


## **Week 2 - Website Design**

# **Design Table**:
| Aspect of Design | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| Landing Page | The landing page should display the logo, and give the user the option to either log in or sign out. When signing up or logging in, the user has the option to enable 'Keep Me Signed In', where this page is skipped and the user is automatically logged in. This option will automatically disable if the user does not log in for 14 days.
